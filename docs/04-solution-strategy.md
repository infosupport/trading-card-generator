# Solution strategy

## Technology choices

- We'll use ASP.NET Core to build the backend API. We use this technology because we're
  demonstrating this application within the context of the Microsoft Community.
- We'll use NextJS for the frontend, because we want rich Javascript functionality in the
  frontend and we want to keep things easy to manage.
- We'll use Azure AI Foundry for generating images because it's what is available and
  approved by the AI governance board at Info Support.

## Approach

- Because this is a one-off application, we'll use an Info Support laptop to run the 
  application. We'll require internet access to the model but we don't use any other
  cloud resource.
